Hey! My name is Chris and I'm currently finalising my masters at the University of Cape Town. I spent it in the [Robotics Lab](https://www.africanroboticsunit.com) working on the mechanical design and control side of a number of legged robot [projects](https://chrismailer.github.io/projects/).

When I'm not working on robots, I love surfing and sailing. At the beginning of 2023 I competed in the [Cape to Rio South Atlantic yacht race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Atlantic_Race) which is the longest continent-to-continent yacht race in the southern hemisphere at around 3200 NM. We broke our rudder and had to divert to the small volcanic island St Helena where I jumped on another boat to Brazil, but that's a fun story for another time.
