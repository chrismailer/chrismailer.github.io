Hey! My name is Chris and I'm currently finalising my masters at the University of Cape Town. I spent it in the [Robotics Lab](https://www.africanroboticsunit.com) working on the Mechanical Design and Control side of a number of legged robots. You can read more about these robots under my [projects](https://chrismailer.github.io/projects/).

When I'm not designing or building controllers for robots, I love surfing and sailing. At the beginning of 2023 I competed in the [Cape to Rio South Atlantic yacht race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Atlantic_Race) which is the longest continent-to-continent yacht race in the southern hemisphere. We broke our rudder and ended up on the small volcanic island St Helena where I jumped on another boat to Brasil, but that's a story for another time.
