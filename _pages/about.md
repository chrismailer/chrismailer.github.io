I am currently finalising a Masters degree at the University of Cape Town focusing on the design, dynamics, and optimal control of a hybrid actuated legged robot. I am truly passionate about the design and control of complex mechatronic systems, and I have experience building and working on multiple robots from my time in UCTâ€™s robotics research lab. I am excited to use these skills to pursue my passion designing and controlling robots which solve hard problems and have a positive impact on our lives.

When I'm not working on robots I love surfing and sailing. At the beginning of 2023 I competed in the Cape to Rio South Atlantic yacht race which is the longest continent-to-continent yacht race in the southern hemisphere.
