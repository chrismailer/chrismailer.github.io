Hey, my name is Christopher Mailer and I am currently finalising my MSc in Mechatronics at the University of Cape Town. For as long as I can remember I've been building and taking things apart. The coupling of hardware, electronics, software, and control and its ability to make a machine _come alive_ has always fascinated and inspired me.

When I'm not tinkering or building things, I love surfing and sailing. At the beginning of 2023 I competed in the Cape to Rio South Atlantic yacht race which is the longest continent-to-continent yacht race in the southern hemisphere. We broke our rudder and ended up on St Helena where I jumped on another boat to Brasil, but that's a story for another time.
