At the end of 2019 I built a 2kg hopping robot for a PhD researcher as part of a 6-week internship for the UCT Robotics Lab. When I joined the lab full-time I took over the project again and ported the system over to the Lab's new Simulink Real-Time Target Machine using the CAN communication protocol, implemented impedance control, and built the Raibert-based control system for consistient hopping and velocity control. You can see the robot hopping and reacting to pushes in this video.
